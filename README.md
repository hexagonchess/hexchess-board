# Hexagonal Chess

This package is a web component implementation of [HexChess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess).

It is designed to be a completely standalone implementation with a fully functioning game engine, so two players can play on a single machine together in person.

Alternatively, it can also be used to analyze games and be fed a pre-determined set of moves.

The component will disallow illegal moves and detect game over states, along with more complex cases such as en passant, preventing moving pinned pieces, and promotions.
